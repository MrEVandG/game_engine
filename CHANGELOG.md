# 3/28/24

I am an American. We do our dates this way. Get over it.

This is the initial commit. I have a window that renders some text, as well as many "helper" files for drawing / playing assets.
These are found in `render/` for graphics and `utils/` for everything else. I know naming a folder "utils" is probably not a good thing, but it works for me.
