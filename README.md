# Game Engine Test

This is a very ambitious project. I will work off and on on this until I eventually lose my sanity and/or energy to work on this any further.

Most of the code from this started from codergopher's amazing 10-video playlist on how to use SDL and SDL_image. Go subscribe to him!

## releases

Github releases are too confusing to setup even though it probably just takes like 2 minutes, but just clone the repo and build the program yourself.

## please help

Although my code doesn't exactly crash, you should probably consider making my code less... terrible.

I am a programmer. That's just how everything naturally turns out when it comes from me...

I digress. This is just a personal hobby I hope I can continue to expand on until my time has been served and some programmer 3 times as capable keeps the ball rolling. (Who knows, it could be *you*!)
