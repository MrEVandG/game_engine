# Game Engine Test

This is a very ambitious project. I will work off and on on this until I eventually lose my sanity and/or energy to work on this any further.

Most of the code from this started from codergopher's amazing 10-video playlist on how to use SDL and SDL_image. Go subscribe to him!

## releases

In order to build this project for yourself, your system must have the following libraries:
- Standard C/C++ libraries
- SDL       - Rendering
- SDL_ttf   - Store and display fonts.
- SDL_image - Store and display textures.
- SDLMixer  - Store and display audio data.

In order to install on Debian-based Linux operating systems, run the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libsdl libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev
```
Sorry, I'm not very experienced with packages, just Google them honestly.

In order to install on Arch-based Linux operating systems, you guys are such massive nerds I probably don't need to give you the command.

Github releases are too confusing to setup even though it probably just takes like 2 minutes, but just clone the repo and build the program yourself.

oh yes important detail but uhh my program seg faults if it can't find the font file I don't know how to fix it but just find a font

## please help

Although my code doesn't exactly crash, you should probably consider making my code less... terrible.

I am a programmer. That's just how everything naturally turns out when it comes from me...

I digress. This is just a personal hobby I hope I can continue to expand on until my time has been served and some programmer 3 times as capable keeps the ball rolling. (Who knows, it could be *you*!)
